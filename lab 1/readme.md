# Dev Kaushik Portfolio

This is my **first personal portfolio website** made using HTML. I made this to show my projects, skills, and to have a place where people can contact me.  

I’m a **first-year B.Tech student** and I’m just starting to explore web development, Python, CSS, and vibe coding. I built this project while learning and experimenting with coding.  

> **Note:** Make sure to add a `image.png` file in the project folder for the profile picture. Otherwise, the profile image will not display on the webpage.

## Projects
- Personal Portfolio Website  
- Calorie Tracking Web App (made using vibe coding)  
- Project Saarthi (Team Vijay — I worked on the front-end)

## Skills
- HTML

## How to Check
1. Download or clone this repository.  
2. Add a `image.png` file for the profile picture in the same folder as `index.html`.  
3. Open `index.html` in a browser.  
4. Check out the sections and projects.  

This is my first step into web development, and I’m learning as I go!
